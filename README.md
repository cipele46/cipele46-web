[Cipele46 Web](http://cipele46.org) is the Web site of the [Cipele46](http://www.facebook.com/Cipele46?) initiative whose 
aim is to connect people in need of some basic stuff (food, clothing) with people who can 
donate some of those things.

The Web site is here to help by providing a place to post ads from both those groups.

It all began with a written ad from a disabled person asking for shoes number 46 ("cipele 46" in Croatian).

## How to contribute

Although the Web site is in Croatian and the initiative is local, you can help by writing some code and making
a pull request. Everyone is welcome. Apart from UI strings, everything else is in English.
